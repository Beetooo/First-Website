            <p>Hi, my name is Beto, thanks for visiting my personal website!</p>
            <p>I am a high school student at Western Technical Commercial School. Next year I plan on going to university to pursue a career in computer science.</p>
            <p>On this site you will find some of my past coding projects and I hope to update it as I develop my coding skills with future projects.</p>

                    <p>This project is one of my favourites, it is a Wordle game that I made in grade 10 as I was first learning python. I made it using python and a module called Pygame. </p>
                    <p>This is not the most difficult project i have ever done, but it took me a while because it is long and I had to learn Pygame. In the end, I think the final product turned out pretty well, although if I were to do it again there would be a few things I would change. It could be written much more efficiently, and it could use a few quality of life features, such as the possible words consisting of only common words and a visual keyboard to indicate what letter have and haven't been used.</p>   
                    <br><br><br>
                    <p>This is the project I did for my culminating in grade 11. It is a program that has several function related to calendars such as printing a full calendar for a given year or month, or telling you the day of the week for a specific date</p>
                    <p>While not too complicated this program uses a wide variety of java functions and techniques and I think it is a cool program</p>

                    <p>There are many more projects that I would love to add to this page which I will add in the near future when I have time.</p>
